# components-extra

React UI components built on top of [styled-components](styled-components.com) & [material-ui components](material-ui.com).

## Motivation

Do you have a web app to develop asap ? With extremely short deadlines ?
Do you want to use [material-design](material.io/design/) standards ?

Well, you are in the right place. This lib was made **just** for **you**.

The aim of the project is to provide **simple-to-use** complex components built on top of material-ui components & standards.

The components are not too generic for this very simple purpose: **save you time**. They focus
on what they were made for. While you may not be able to customize them from the bottom to the top,
you can bring your own **theme** to customize them with your own styleguide.
