# Components-extra and Server Side Rendering

## How to use components-extra with Gatsby.js ?

All components of **components-extra** are Server-Side-Rendering friendly, so you can totaly integrate them
in your SSR app.

If you are using the awesome framework [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) (if you are not, you should definitely try it!), you will need to add
two plugins in your `gatsby-config.js` file to make **components-extra** work smoothly:

- [gatsby-plugin-styled-components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-styled-components/)
- [gatsby-plugin-material-ui](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-material-ui/)

> **Note:** Those are not required to make your app compile correctly, however you might experience some display issues if you don't
use them.
