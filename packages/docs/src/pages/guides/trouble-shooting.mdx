# TroubleShooting

## Module not found: Can't resolve 'styled-components'

If you encounter the error `Module not found: Can't resolve 'styled-components' in [...]` it probably means that you
need to install the [styled-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-components) library in your project as stated
in the [Get Started guide](/#get-started).

Indeed, **components-extra** relies on *styled-components* for its styling system. It is not included in the bundle in
order to prevent any duplicated instance of *styled-components* in your final bundle.

## Module not found: Can't resolve '@material-ui/core'

If you encounter the error `Module not found: Can't resolve '@material-ui/core' in [...]` it probably means that you
need to install the [@material-ui/core >= 4.0.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@material-ui/core) library in your project as stated
in the [Get Started guide](/#get-started).

Indeed, all the components are built on top of Material-UI.
