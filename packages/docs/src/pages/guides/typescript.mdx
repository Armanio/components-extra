# TypeScript

Components-extra requires a minimum version of `TypeScript@3.8`.

Since **v3.0.0**, the library fully supports TypeScript. 

All the components export their **Props** [interface](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html)
and their **Types**. That means you can fully take leverage of their typings system, and extend them in your own project,
and integrate them in other components.

Every component is exported as a [styled-component](https://styled-components.com/) and forward the `ref` you attach to it
to the root HTML element it renders. You can learn more about react and the refs on [nocode nobug's article](https://nocode-nobug.com/what-is-hidden-behind-react-refs/).

All the types & interfaces can be imported from the index **root**, just like the components are.

## Example

Say, for example, that you're working with the [CookiesBanner](/components/cookies-banner) component. You
can make a new component on top of it using TypeScript this way:


```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { CookiesBanner, CookiesBannerProps } from 'components-extra'

interface ExtendedCookiesBannerProps extends CookiesBannerProps {
  caption: string
}

const ExtendedCookiesBanner: React.FC<ExtendedCookiesBannerProps> = ({ caption, ...rest }) => {

  return (
    <div>
      <CookiesBanner {...rest} />
      <span>{caption}</span>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Your `ExtendedCookiesBanner` will inherit from all the props of `CookiesBanner`, plus the one you defined (here `caption`).

## Further reading

Since **components-extra** is built on top of Material-UI, you can also leverage all the typing system they offer: https://material-ui.com/guides/typescript/.
That includes for example overriding the theme types.

## What about prop-types ?

In addition to the TypeScript typings, all the components are also declaring their props using [PropTypes](https://material-ui.com/guides/typescript/). Doing so,
you will have both type checking at **compilation** time (Nodejs - TypeScript) and **execution** time (Browser - PropTypes).

Since TypeScript's integration in React is "relatively" recent, some changes are to be expected, and you should take into account the fact that this library
is not in its mature state yet using TypeScript. Do not hesitate to open issues or PRs if you encounter any issue using TypeScript with components-extra.
