# Components-extra and Server Side Rendering

## Gatsby.js

All components of **components-extra** are Server-Side-Rendering friendly, so you can totaly integrate them
in your SSR app.

If you are using the awesome framework [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) (if you are not, you should definitely try it!), you will need to add
two plugins in your `gatsby-config.js` file to make **components-extra** work smoothly:

- [gatsby-plugin-styled-components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-styled-components/)
- [gatsby-plugin-material-ui](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-material-ui/)

> **Note:** Those are not required to make your app compile correctly, however you might experience some display issues if you don't
use them.

## Next.js

In order to use **components-extra** with [next.js](https://nextjs.org/), there are a couple of steps to follow:

- Add [next-transpile-modules](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-transpile-modules) in your next.js config to transpile both Material-UI & components-extra:

```js
// next.config.js
const withTM = require("next-transpile-modules")([
  "@material-ui/core",
  "components-extra"
]); // pass the modules you would like to see transpiled

module.exports = withTM();
```

- Inject `styled-components` styles in the `<Head>` of your pages: see https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced#nextjs.
- Add a `babelrc` config to handle `styled-components` in SSR:

```js
{
  "presets": [
    "next/babel"
  ],
  "plugins": [
    [
      "styled-components",
      {
        "ssr": true
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

And that should be it. You can find a working integration on the following codesandbox:
