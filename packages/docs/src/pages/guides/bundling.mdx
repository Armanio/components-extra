# Bundling components-extra in your project

## Optimizing bundle size

**components-extra** is tree-shakeable, meaning that you can import its components as named imports, like this:

```jsx
import { BackToTop } from 'components-extra'
```

If your bundler is set up to use the tree-shakeable libraries, it will automatically **only add the named imports
you used**. In this example, only the `<BackToTop>` button will be included in your bundle.

Else, if your bundler is not set up to do tree-shaking, you can still only include the components you need
by importing them as defaults like this:

```jsx
import BackToTop from 'components-extra/components/BackToTop'
```

> **Note:** you will need a transpiler like [babel](https://babeljs.io/) to make the JS work in the browser. (Even if es6 is coming soon to moder broswers).
Some projects templates (like [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)) handle this for you by default.

## es5

If your project is not set up to transpile the **esm/es** builds, you can still use the **cjs**, written in es5:

```jsx

const BackToTop = require("components-extra").BackToTop
```

> **Note:** you can also set up aliases in your project to alias `components-extra/components` to `components-extra` if you want imports to
look like `import BackToTop from 'components-extra/BackToTop'`. You can check out how to do this with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/)
and with [babel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-module-resolver).
